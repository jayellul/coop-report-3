    <h1>Co-op Work Term Report: Third Term's the Charm</h1>
    <p>By: <b>Jason Ellul</b> 12/30/2020</p>

    <h2>Information About the Employer</h2>

    <p>Tag Digital Studios is an agency that specializes in building custom software solutions for all kinds of clientele. Despite having a smaller in-house team of only around 10 employees, Tag works with partnering agencies to tackle large scale projects. Most of the team is made up of developers, including myself - who worked as a web developer during my co-op term from January to September.</p>
    <p>The Tag Digital Studios office is located in Guelph, Ontario. The office space is extremely interesting; a mansion built in the 1800s that is now utilized by Tag and a few other companies. For the first few months of my co-op term, up until about March I was going into the office everyday. Due to the unprecedented times caused by COVID-19, I resigned to working from home for the remainder of the term. </p>
    <p>Tag has amazing company culture. For instance, we are all coffee lovers and coffee is taken very seriously at the office. There’s even a specific algorithm they use to brew the “perfect coffee” - which I must say is actually really good. We also partake in a happy hour every Friday, concluding the day by sitting around talking about our weekend plans while sharing beers. Tag even kept the culture alive while working from home by dropping off desserts or drinks at my house, or ordering pizza to everyone's house. </p>

    <h2>Job Description</h2>

    <p>As a web developer I was expected to make significant technical contributions to each project I was involved in. Being in a smaller company of course meant I had to wear many hats, taking responsibilities for tasks such as writing my own tests (utilizing test-driven development), providing quality assurance on my website stylesheets, and communicating with clients to ensure their needs were met and understood. This was an amazing experience to have as a co-op since I was exposed to so many roles and kinds of work. </p>
    <p>On the job, I discovered that one of my favorite parts of projects was talking to clients. Every month or so, I would shift gears to a different project, working with a different agency or client. I really enjoyed meeting and collaborating with all of the different people, it gave me the opportunity to get a sense of the different careers and roles within the software industry. The amount of exposure I received from working with different teams every month was extremely beneficial to the co-op experience. </p>
    <p>A majority of the software projects that I contributed to during my co-op term was marketing websites. We used Gatsby.js for the frontend, which was a great solution utilizing the development speed of React while rendering static server-side rendered pages, which retained the speed and SEO of other solutions. Many of these sites also required a CMS (content- management system) where the client could go in and change the content or layout of the site themselves. We commonly use Wordpress or Craft as a base, requiring an extensive amount of work to customize the CMS exactly to the clients’ needs. </p>
    <p>Working on a different project every month or so was also beneficial to my technical experience. We did have certain tools we would prefer to develop in, but sometimes this was not feasible for the requirements of a project so we would always use the best technical solution, even if there had to be a bit of learning done by the developers to utilize the programming language. Given a new project, I had to quickly learn and adopt the technicalities to stay on time and budget. Throughout my co-op term, I got exposure to reading and writing production code in so many different web languages; such as Javascript (React, Gatsby, and Node frameworks), PHP, Ruby, Rails, CSS (SCSS and Sass), Twig, HTML, Coffeescript, and Haml. </p>

    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  
    <h3>Goal #1 - Integrative Communication</h3>

    <p>My first goal was that I wanted more experience with communicating with clients at all points in the project lifecycle. To strive towards this goal, I constantly made an effort to get involved and communicate with the client on projects. I took initiative where appropriate to make sure that I fully understand the clients requests, and that a positive relationship is established.</p>
    <p>I measured my success for this goal by gauging how the client responds, as well as asking for specific feedback in project post-mortem meetings. I would say that I achieved this goal since I was able to get a ton of experience with clients throughout the term, and there was an abundance of positive feedback. Clients loved my positive attitude and ability to pivot on a rapidly changing project quickly and effectively. There was one project where I had negative feedback from the client, but I also learned a lot from this experience and will be sure not to repeat the mistakes I made in the future. </p>
  
    <h3>Goal #2 - Technological Literacy</h3>

    <p>My second goal was to get more experience using languages, frameworks, or technologies I don’t have much proficiency in. To achieve this goal, I took initiative to ask my company to work on projects where I'm in unfamiliar territory. This will force me to quickly learn new languages that I can add to my resume, as well as discover what I'm interested in. </p>
    <p>I measured my success for this goal by seeing if I can contribute to projects this term where I work in a language that I've never worked in before. I would like to think that I achieved this goal because I worked on about 8 projects throughout the term; all of which introduced a new framework or language to me. Making significant contributions to all these projects, I had to learn and adapt to the new technology to write effective production code. This was extremely beneficial to broadening my developer skill set. </p>

    <h3>Goal #3 - Visual Literacy</h3>

    <p>My final goal was to better understand web design patterns and further the abilities of website design. Though it is not part of my job as a developer, I will study all of the designs that get sent to me that I'm supposed to create. This also includes obtaining more experience with design software like Sketch. My reasoning behind this goal is because web design is something I have done before on previous co-op terms, and is something that I am passionate about. </p>
    <p>My measure of success for this goal was seeing if my ability to recognize patterns and trends in web design improved, as well as my ability to utilize industry standard software. I think that I partially achieved this goal. Although I did not get to design any websites myself during the term (since we are typically given designs from clients), I typically had to come up with design specifications that were missing, particularly mobile and tablet views. Looking at and implementing designs for multiple websites was great design experience since I had to learn the software that was used by the client (Sketch, Photoshop, inVision, XD) as well as broke down the common design trends seen on various websites I had to develop. I would have ideally liked more experience doing this, but again, creating whole designs was not encapsulated in my job so the interpretation of other peoples’ designs was the kind of goal related experience I received from the term. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion & Acknowledgments</h2>

    <p>In conclusion, my third co-op term as a web developer went better than I could have ever imagined. While working for an agency, I gained lots of hands-on work experience with web programming, project lifecycles, and client communications. I successfully achieved all of the learning goals that I set to improve – my integrative communication, technological literacy, and visual literacy skills were all exercised over the course of the term. These skills and experiences will no doubt prove useful for future employment opportunities in software development. I am very proud of the projects and work I have done thus far for Tag and I am looking forward to continuing my employment part-time during next semester. Overall, I have come a long way from where I started, and it is truly interesting to reflect on how much I have learned in just 8 months.</p>
    <p>I have greatly enjoyed working alongside the team and appreciate how welcome you have all made me feel the past 8 months. I also appreciate all of the help you’ve given me when I’m stuck on a project, as well as all of the feedback you have provided me to improve on myself so early in my career. Thank you to all my coworkers for being such great colleagues and making this co-op term such an enjoyable and memorable learning experience!</p>
